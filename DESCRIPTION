Description: Generate, validate, and check your items for quality and redundancy using AI-GENIE (Generative Psychometrics via AI-GENIE: Automatic Item Generation and Validation via Network-Integrated Evaluation). AI-GENIE is a methodology that lowers several barriers to developing high-quality and theoretically-informed scales. The pipeline combines the latest open-source LLMs and generative artificial intelligence with advances in network psychometrics to facilitate scale generation, selection, and validation. Our process eliminates the need to generate hundreds of items by content experts, recruit diverse and experienced researchers, administer the items to (as well as compensate) thousands of participants, and employ modern psychometric methods in the data collected in this process.
