\usage{
GENIE(
  items,
  openai.API,
  EGA.model = NULL,
  EGA.algorithm = "walktrap",
  embedding.model = "text-embedding-3-small",
  plot = TRUE,
  plot.stability = FALSE,
  calc.final.stability = FALSE,
  silently = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{items}{A required data frame containing the item pool. This data frame must include at least three columns:
\code{statement} (the item text), \code{type} (the item type label), and \code{attribute} (the associated attribute/characteristic).
The pool should contain at least 50 unique items overall, with at least 15 items per distinct item type.}

\item{openai.API}{A required character string containing your OpenAI API key.}

\item{EGA.model}{An optional character string specifying the EGA model to use (e.g., \code{"tmfg"} or \code{"glasso"}). If set to \code{NULL},
both models are evaluated, and the one with the highest Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is selected.}

\item{EGA.algorithm}{A character string specifying the clustering algorithm for EGA. Options include \code{"walktrap"}, \code{"louvain"}, or \code{"leiden"}. Defaults to \code{"walktrap"}.}

\item{embedding.model}{A character string specifying the OpenAI embedding model to use (e.g., \code{"text-embedding-3-small"}, \code{"text-embedding-3-large"}, or \code{"text-embedding-ada-002"}).
Defaults to \code{"text-embedding-3-small"}.}

\item{plot}{Logical; defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, network plots comparing the item pool before and after reduction are generated.}

\item{plot.stability}{Logical; defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, secondary network stability plots are generated.}

\item{calc.final.stability}{Logical; defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, bootstrapped stability analysis is performed (this may significantly increase computation time).}

\item{silently}{Logical; defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, console output is suppressed.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to underlying functions in the pipeline.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{overall_sample}}{
A list containing the overall sample-level analysis results:
\itemize{
\item \code{main_result}: A data frame of the refined item pool after reduction, including columns such as \code{ID}, \code{type}, \code{statement}, and \code{EGA_communities}.
\item \code{final_ega_obj}: The final EGA object after reduction.
\item \code{final_bootega_obj}: The final bootstrapped EGA (bootEGA) object after reduction (if stability analysis was performed).
\item \code{initial_ega_obj}: The initial EGA object computed on the full generated pool.
\item \code{initial_bootega_obj}: The initial bootEGA object computed on the redundancy-reduced items.
\item \code{selected_model}: The EGA model used throughout the pipeline (either as specified or selected based on NMI).
\item \code{nmi}: The final Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) value after reduction.
\item \code{start_nmi}: The NMI value computed on the original generated item pool.
\item \code{start_N}: The number of items in the initial generated pool.
\item \code{final_N}: The number of items in the final refined pool.
\item \code{network_plot}: A network plot object comparing the pre- and post-reduction item networks.
\item \code{stability_plot}: A stability plot object (if \code{calc.final.stability = TRUE}).
\item \code{embeddings}: A list of embeddings used in the analysis. This list includes:
\itemize{
\item \code{full}: The full embeddings matrix for the reduced items.
\item \code{sparse}: A sparsified version of the embeddings.
\item \code{embed_type_used}: A string indicating whether "full" or "sparse" embeddings were ultimately used.
}
}
}
\item{\code{item_type_level}}{
A named list containing analysis results for each individual item type.
Each element is a list with the corresponding output (with the same structure as the the overall sample output)
for that item type.
}
}
}
\description{
This function validates an existing item pool and performs redundancy reduction and network-based quality assessment using AI-GENIE. It is intended for cases where the item pool is already generated. GENIE:
\itemize{
\item Validates the provided item data using \code{GENIE_checks} (ensuring correct format, absence of missing or duplicate items, and that item attributes match the data).
\item Embeds the items using the specified OpenAI embedding model.
\item Runs the reduction pipeline (via \code{run_pipeline}) to remove redundant items and to perform Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) and bootstrapped EGA for further refinement.

# Add an OpenAI API key

## Create a data frame of items to reduce - for this example, we will focus only on Neuroticism and Extraversion

## Neuroticism items (example for the 'anxious' attribute)

                "The thought of uncertainty makes me feel uneasy.",
                "I often feel on edge and apprehensive about the future.",
                "I tend to overthink and dwell on negative possibilities.",
                "I often find myself anticipating the worst possible outcome.",
                "I frequently feel a sense of dread without any specific reason.",
                "I often feel a sense of impending doom for no reason.",

                             "I confidently speak my mind and stand up for what I believe in.",
                             "Taking the lead in group settings is something I excel at without hesitation.",
