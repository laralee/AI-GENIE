\usage{
GENIE(
  items,
  openai.API,
  EGA.model = NULL,
  plot = TRUE,
  plot.stability = FALSE,
  calc.final.stability = FALSE,
  silently = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{items}{A required data frame containing your item statements and item type labels. The data frame should have two columns: one containing the item statements and one containing the item type labels. The column names do not need to be specific; the function will determine which column contains the item statements and which contains the item type labels. There must be at least two distinct item types which each contain at least 15 items. The total number of unique items should be at least 50.}

\item{openai.API}{A required character string of your OpenAI API key.}

\item{EGA.model}{A character string specifying the model to use with Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA). Options are \code{"tmfg"} or \code{"glasso"}. Defaults to \code{tmfg}. If set to \code{NULL}, both models are tested, and the one yielding the best Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is returned.}

\item{plot}{Logical; defaults to \code{TRUE}. Specifies whether to display summary network plots.}

\item{plot.stability}{Logical; defaults to \code{FALSE}. Specifies whether to display the secondary network stability plots.}

\item{calc.final.stability}{Logical; defaults to \code{FALSE}. Specifies whether to compute the stability of the item pool before and after item reduction. Setting this parameter to \code{TRUE} significantly increases computational expense. Changing this value will NOT change item reduction outcome.}

\item{silently}{Logical; defaults to \code{FALSE}. When \code{TRUE}, suppresses console output.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{main_result}}{A data frame of the item pool after AI-GENIE reduction. The data frame has the columns \code{ID}, \code{type}, \code{statement}, and \code{EGA_communities}.}
\item{\code{final_ega_obj}}{The final EGA object after reduction.}
\item{\code{final_bootega_obj}}{The final bootEGA object after reduction.}
\item{\code{initial_ega_obj}}{The initial EGA object with the entire item pool.}
\item{\code{initial_bootega_obj}}{The initial bootEGA object generated from redundancy-reduced data.}
\item{\code{embeddings}}{The embeddings generated for the items.}
\item{\code{embedding_type}}{The type of embeddings used ("sparse" or "full").}
\item{\code{selected_model}}{The EGA model used throughout the pipeline.}
\item{\code{nmi}}{The Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) of the final item pool.}
\item{\code{start_nmi}}{The NMI of the original item pool.}
\item{\code{start_N}}{The starting sample size (number of items).}
\item{\code{final_N}}{The final sample size after reduction.}
\item{\code{original_items (optional)}}{(ONLY returns if \code{keep.org} is \code{TRUE}) The original sample generated.}
}
}
\description{
Validate and assess your existing items for quality and redundancy using AI-GENIE (Automatic Item Generation and Validation via Network-Integrated Evaluation). This function embeds user-provided items and performs AI-GENIE item validation and redundancy reduction to refine the item pool.
